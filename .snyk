# Snyk (https://snyk.io) policy file, patches or ignores known vulnerabilities.
version: v1.25.0

# Ignore specific vulnerabilities
ignore:
  # Hardcoded password in seed file
  # This is acceptable because:
  # - Only used in development/test database seeding
  # - Password is now stored in environment variable (SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD)
  # - Seed file is never executed in production
  # - Password is hashed before storage using bcrypt

        reason: 'Development seed file only, uses env var with fallback, never runs in production'
        expires: '2027-01-22T00:00:00.000Z'
        
  'snyk:lic:CWE-798':
    - 'prisma/seed.ts':
        reason: 'Seed password now uses SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD env var, this file is dev-only'
        expires: '2027-01-22T00:00:00.000Z'

# Note: This file should be reviewed periodically to ensure
# ignored vulnerabilities are still valid and properly mitigated.
# The seed file should NEVER be included in production builds.
